## ⚡ Quick Tips

1. **Start Subtle**
   - Default settings are intentionally gentle
   - Increase Drive/Mix gradually

2. **Use Your Ears**
   - Bypass frequently (compare)
   - Don't rely only on meters

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - High Drive + Low Mix = Punch
   - Great for drums and bass

4. **Oversampling**
   - 2x for mixing (default)
   - 4x for mastering
   - Off if CPU is limited

5. **Output Matching**
   - Match input/output levels
   - Avoid "louder = better" trap

6. **Halo Engine**
   - Try toggling ON for more character
   - Visual glow shows intensity
